## 📌 Overview

**TrafficGuard AI** is a full-stack intelligent traffic monitoring system designed to detect, analyze, and report traffic violations from video footage.

The system combines:

* 🧠 **YOLOv8 deep learning models** for object detection
* 📏 **Rule-based verification engine** for identifying violations
* 📊 **Modern React dashboard** for visualization and control

It is inspired by real-world **smart city traffic monitoring systems** and aligns with research-based multi-stage architectures.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js ≥ 18
* Python ≥ 3.9
* MongoDB

---

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trafficguard-ai.git

# Go to project
cd trafficguard-ai

# Install frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Run backend
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Render Deployment

This repository includes a Render-ready Docker configuration for the full stack.
The single Docker service builds the frontend, installs backend Node dependencies, installs Python ML requirements, and starts both the Python AI engine and Express backend.

1. Create a Render Web Service from this repo.
2. Set the service runtime to `Docker`.
3. Use the default `Dockerfile` in the repo root.
4. Add required environment variables in Render:
   - `MONGO_URI` for your MongoDB connection string
   - `GOOGLE_GENAI_KEY` if you use the LLM service
5. Deploy.

If you want to deploy only the frontend separately, host the backend elsewhere and point `VITE_API_URL` to that backend.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. Upload traffic video
2. YOLO detects vehicles and objects
3. Rule engine checks violations
4. Violations are logged and displayed
5. Reports are generated

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Endpoint              | Description            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `POST /upload`        | Upload video           |
| `GET /violations`     | Get all violations     |
| `GET /violations/:id` | Get specific violation |
| `GET /stats`          | Dashboard data         |
